## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#4F39D5) for the main interactive elements like the 'Sign In' button. It brings an element of modernity without being overly vibrant, for a comfortable sign-in process.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) as the backdrop to keep the layout light and neutral.
- Accent color: Soft magenta (#D5398B) for highlights and less frequent user interface elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern aesthetic across all text elements.
- Maintain a clean, centered layout with sufficient whitespace around the elements for better readability.
- Use simple, line-style icons for the password visibility toggle and error indicators.
- Use a subtle transition effect on the 'Sign In' button hover state to provide feedback to the user.
